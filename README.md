# Energy-in-Chaos-GPU-Simulation-
Energy in Chaos is a real-time GPU-accelerated particle simulation built with Three.js, WebGL2, and custom GLSL shaders. It visualizes turbulent, chaotic energy using curl noise, 3D simplex noise, GPGPU physics, and instanced rendering, capable of animating up to 1,000,000 particles at interactive framerates.
